The elements of the array are in the range from 1 to 'N'.
Ideally, the array should contain elements from 1 to 'NÂ°. But due to some miscalculations, there is a number R in the range [1, N] which appears in the array twice and another number
M in the range [1, N] which is missing from the array.
Your task is to find the missing number (M) and the repeating number (R).</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [ 6, 4, 3, 5, 5, 1 ]
<strong>Output:</strong> [ 2, 5 ]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Consider an array of size six. The elements of the array are { 6, 4, 3, 5, 5, 1 }.
The array should contain elements from one to six. Here, 2 is not present and 5 is occurring twice. Thus, 2 is the missing number (M) and 5 is the repeating number (R).
